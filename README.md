# Opt Art: Chess Piece Mosaics

This work is a mini research project related to the contents of the OR1 lecture by Prof. Dr. LÃ¼bbecke of the [Operations Research chair][1] at the RWTH Aachen University and adopts principles presented in the book "[Opt Art: From Mathematical Optimization to Visual Design][2]" by Robert Bosch.

Mosaic of current world chess champion Magnus Carlsen with a FIDE classical time rating of 2847 ELO (as of 4th March 2021) using 2847 complete chess piece sets.
Half of the total amount of each piece received a light and the other half a dark background shade.

Mosaic of Beth Harmon (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) from the 2020 Netflix series "Queen's Gambit" using 2020 complete chess piece sets.
Half of the total amount of each piece received a light and the other half a dark background shade.

## Setup & Usage

```sh
# the tested python version can be found in .python-version
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
# manually install the correct version of gurobipy before continuing with the other dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# adjust the parameters for the mosaic manually in Prototype.py
# - desired target image: target_path
# - desired number of complete chess piece sets: num_sets
# - the default piece set and background combination should work fine in the majority of cases
# --> for customization consult findings in Brightness-Analysis.md
python3 Prototype.py
# - target greyscale image: Target.png
# - output mosaic: Mosaic.png
```

- Note on limitations: As there is a fixed number of mosaic tiles which has to be used in the final result, it is not possible to model arbitrary aspect ratios for a specific `num_sets` value. Thus, if the output mosaic looks distorted try your luck again with a different `num_sets` value.

## Extension Ideas

- Enable input parameters via CLI arguments or JSON files
- Automate best `num_sets` value search for a given predefined set of desirable options
- Consider adding blank board tiles which enables the generation of mosaics from individual board positions or complete games
- Add additional LP constraints to prevent the same piece configuration being placed adjacent to itself
- Add additional LP constraints to construct an actual checkerboard pattern in the background
